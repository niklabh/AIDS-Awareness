This is a android app on the subject of AIDS Awareness.
As we all know that AIDS is one of the most  deadly diseases of the planet and
a threat to mankind. The perfect cure of AIDS is not discovered yet. Prevention is the best cure for aids. So this app provide awareness about aids . There is also a fun quiz on the subject.
I want to improve the project by adding features like google maps for location of help centers. A live feed of the AIDS/HIV from the internet perhaps by using google reader API.
There are a number of issues
-- Share page is not working properly
-- Feedback page is sending data to a unknown location.
-- True/False section is incomplete

The app is made by using PHONEGAP for android. So major code is inside /asset/www folder.
